# ev-charging-monitor
A web application to monitor the charging of electric vehicles in a single household

In the near future, electric vehicles will be common place. The situation of multiple EV owner's charging their cars under a single household and bill will arise. The housemates would need an accurate way to split the bill. This project seeks to solve this problem by monitoring and logging the energy used during each charging session. If the energy used per billing period by each household member is known, splitting the bill becomes a trivial task. This solution also seek's to be agnostic to EV make and model; a CT sensor measure current draw from the charging cable.
